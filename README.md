# 2017-Tshirt-Design

Attached you will find the Open Source files for the 2017/2018 SecKC T-Shirt Design.  The basic design has been posted, but we are askign the community to add their 'flair'.  This could be some messages in code, SecKC Lore, or any other thing that will make the design more 'SecKC'

Since the theme is 'Ascii Art' make sure to view the files in 'RAW' format to see how they will print.  The images below are the very beginning concept art, and just to give you are representation of the 'feel'.  The final concept will be printed from the final documents here in github.
